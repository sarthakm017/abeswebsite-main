# Few Suggesstions:

# Since the page is static we can use server side rendering for making this(like Next.js) but since this is developed using HTML/CSS I have made changes in those files only.

# We can create our own UI library for making the components(button,typography,dropdown,slider etc) and can use those components all accross the page

# To make page load faster we can also use incremental rendering/lazy loading and based on proirity we can render the UI
