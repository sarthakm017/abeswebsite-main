          The National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) is an
          autonomous Government body funded by the University Grants Commission
          (UGC) that assesses and accredits Higher Education Institutions in
          India. The NAAC conducts assessment and accreditation to derive an
          understanding of the ‘Quality Status’ of the institution. NAAC
          evaluates the institutions for its conformance to the standards of
          quality in terms of its performance related to the educational
          processes and outcomes, curriculum coverage, teaching-learning
          processes, faculty, research, infrastructure, learning resources,
          organization, governance, financial well being and student services.
