          The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an
          independent, non-governmental organization, the members of which are
          the standard organizations of the 165 member countries. ISO is the
          Worldâ€™s best-known quality management standard for companies and
          organizations of any size. Among various standards of ISO, ISO
          9001:2015 specifies requirements for a quality management system for
          organizations having the ability to consistently provide products and
          services that meet customer and applicable statutory and regulatory
          requirements. It aims to enhance customer satisfaction through the
          effective application of the system, including processes for
          improvement of the system and the assurance of conformity to customer
          and applicable statutory and regulatory requirements.
